# Rmlogs

## About
This is a simple mod that allows you to remove unused or otherwise unwanted log files. This is made possible with an intuitive GUI
that allows you to easily remove the log files with just the push of a button!

This is a simple mod, however, it will continue to be updated and supported for more functionality in the future.

## Use and Installation
* This mod will be uploaded to Modrinth in the future and that is where you can install the .jar files.
the .jar can be installed from this Modrinth link: https://modrinth.com/mod/rmlogs

* After these .jar files are installed you should copy or move them over into your "mods" folder and make sure that the fabric 
api is also present in the "mods" folder.

After these steps are complete the mod should be installed.
